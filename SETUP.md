## Troubleshooting

### CSS Warnings
You may see warnings about `@tailwind` and `@apply` directives in your IDE. These are expected and will be processed correctly by Tailwind/PostCSS when the app runs.

### Dependencies Not Installing
If you encounter issues with npm install:
1. Delete `node_modules` folder
2. Delete `package-lock.json`
3. Run `npm install` again

### Port Already in Use
If port 5173 is busy:
- Vite will automatically try the next available port
- Or you can specify a port: `npm run dev -- --port 3000`

## Next Steps

After setup, explore:
1. Toggle between light and dark themes
2. Navigate through different sections
3. Try creating jobs and candidates
4. Test the Kanban board drag-and-drop
5. View toast notifications on actions
